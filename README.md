# w3sols
My guides to the w3challs - series of pentesting challenges. I now write my guides in both English and Italian. Hence why there are **english/** and **italian/** directories.

## Category Directory Structure
The w3challs are split into six different categories:
- Crypto: Reverse-engineer cryptosystems, algorithms, etc
- Forensics: Perform data analysis, recovery, and malware analysis
- Reversing: Reverse-engineer binaries
- Pwning: Exploit binaries using buffer overflows, heap attacks, etc
- Web: Analyze web application vulnerabilities
- Misc: Everything else related to hacking.

## Challenge Directory Structure
Within each category directory is a challenge directory, and the structure of these directories is made simple to make learning easy. Every challenge has a README.MD with two main sections:
- The challenge details and a list of challenge files within the same directory
- The guide to solving the challenge and a list of solution files within the same directory

The README.MD files will not contain the answers, but there will be solution files for each directory which you can use to check your work. Please do not view the solutions before following the guide. I want people learn, not look up answers.

## Terms of Use
By viewing my guides, you agree to the following:
- You will not use this material to cheat in any academic setting.
- You may use this material to teach yourself or others in an academic setting.
- You agree to attempt the challenges before viewing the solution files.
