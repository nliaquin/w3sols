# w3sols
My guides to the w3challs. A series of pentesting challenges.

## Category Directory Structure
The w3challs are split into six different categories:
- Crypto: Reverse engineer cryptosystems, algorithms, etc
- Forensics: Conduct data analysis, data recovery, and malware analysis
- Reversing: Reverse engineer binaries
- Pwning: Perform binary exploitation, buffer overflows, heap exploits, etc
- Web: Web application vulnerability analysis and server-side exploitation
- Misc: Hacking everything else

## Challenge Directory Structure
Within each category directory is a challenge directory, and the structure of these directories is made simple to make learning easy. Every challenge has a README.MD with two main sections:
- 1. The challenge details and a list of challenge files within the same directory
- 2. The guide to solving the challenge and a list of solution files within the same directory

The README.MD files will not contain the answers, but there will be solution files for each directory which you can use to check your work. Please do not view the solutions before following the guide. I want people learn, not look up answers.

## Terms of Use
By viewing my guides, you agree to the following:
- You will not use my work to cheat in an academic setting.
- You may use my work to teach others in an academic setting.
- You agree to at least attempt the challenges before viewing the solution files.
